Getting MySQL running on Mac OSX:

	1)	 Downloand the .dmg file. 
	⁃	I followed the instructions listed here (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation-pkg.html). 
	⁃	download .dmg file
	⁃	Run the .pkg file
	⁃	you will be prompted wioth a temporary password. SAVE THE TEMP PASSWORD! I took a screenshot of the window for future reference. 
	2)	Open the MySQL Monitor in Terminal
	⁃	Run the following commands:
	⁃	alias mysql=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
	⁃	alias mysqladmin=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
	⁃	mysql -u root -p
  
	⁃	Enter in the temp password that the .pkg file gave you earlier. 
	⁃	You should be in the MySQL Monitor at this point. 
	3)	Change the root password.
	⁃	In order to do anything, you will need to change the root password to something custom.
	⁃	Run the following command once you are in the MySQL Monitor
	⁃	ALTER USER 'root’@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NEW_PASSWORD';
	⁃	No special characters in the new password. 


At this point, you should be able to create and manage databases through the terminal window. For more reference material on MySQL, check out http://dev.mysql.com/doc/
